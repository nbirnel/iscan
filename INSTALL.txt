You'll need to install Autohotkey for this to work

http:\\www.autohotkey.com\download\AutoHotkeyInstall.exe

You may wish to edit usr\iscan_rc.ahk for some handy network support.

Then run installer.bat in the appropriate driver directory, eg:
  drivers\RicohPRO1357ex\installer.bat

Or edit computers.txt in the appropriate driver directory, then
run multi-machine-installer.bat, eg:
  drivers\RicohPRO1357ex\computers.txt
  drivers\RicohPRO1357ex\multi-machine-installer.bat
