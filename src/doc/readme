This is not where the documentation is kept. This is where the source for 
documentation is kept.

To get the actual documentation, go to the appropriate driver directory.

To update documentation for a new TWAIN driver:

    1 Edit the iscan_help.driver.but in the driver directory
    2 Run make

makeDoc depends on halibut, perl, lynx, bash, and the script descHTML2tabHTML.
Halibut can be found at 
    http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/halibut/
Perl, lynx, make and bash are preinstalled on most sane systems, and can be easily
enough installed on Windows and OS X systems.

This assumes you are using Cygwin on Windows. Otherwise - figure it out
yourself.
