                       ScanHotKeys help file - iScan.ahk

   This program makes IproScan and the various Twain drivers respond to
   single stroke keyboard shortcuts. It is meant to make scanning easier
   and faster.

   Start Scan.ahk after you have started your Twain driver. A window will
   pop up showing what windows the program intends to send its clicks to.
   Hit enter or click OK.

   A status bar will show in the upper left hand corner of the screen. It
   will show that hotkeys are on and superscan is off.

   While hotkeys are on, your keyboard strokes are interpretted as the
   list below. YOU CAN'T DO ANY DATA ENTRY, SO LEARN THE WINDOWS-[ COMMAND
   FIRST. (That's the one that toggles the hotkeys on and off.)

   There is no need to learn >all< of these shortcuts. Start off learning
   how to toggle the hotkeys on and off, superscan, the document breaks,
   and how to quit the program. That might be all you ever want to use.
   You can still use the mouse.
